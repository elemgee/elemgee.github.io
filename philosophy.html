<p>The name "Webfarm" and our philosophy of business and development are rooted in 
an ecological approach to systems. I am not speaking specifically of "green" technologies
but a general approach to technology and business as an "ecology" where all parts of 
the system are considered in developing a strong, flexible, sustainable system. 
</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable developments in network services has been the
emergence of the web itself (the combination of the HTTP protocol and content authored
in HTML). It is no secret that both HTTP and HTML are not the most sophisticated
or powerful technologies. The success of the web and the amazing growth in usage
and evolution is due to many factors, but the right combination of simplicity and
extensibility attracted increasing participation that fed development and further
adoption. HTML is a weaker, less capable dialect of SGML, but even though SGML had been
around quite a while before HTML appeared on the scene, the simplicity of using HTML
allowed the explosion of content on the web and even the misuse of HTML provided 
some value. 
</p>
<p>The point of this story is not to be disrespectful of the protocols of the web, but
to illustrate the astonishing success of small, simple, extensible, flexible components
in a distributed information ecology. Our focus and goal is to arrange
the right components in order to achieve
not only the success of a particular project but the sustainability and ability to 
evolve with the people and the business needs. We are not opposed to large scale
reengineering of systems when that is necessary, but systems designed from the 
begining with an eye toward evolution and renewability resist the need for large
scale reengineering and the disruption that brings.
</p>
<p>Strong. Sustainable. Flexible.</p>
